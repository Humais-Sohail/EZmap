EZmap is a tool that simplifies the nmap scanning. It uses nmap under the hood.

It is written entirely in C++

To use this, you must have nmap installed on your system otherwise it wont work.

Install nmap regarding to your OS or distro

For Example:
sudo apt install nmap
sudo pacman -S nmap

This tool simplifies basic scanning and is not recommended for advance scanning.

you must use sudo inorder to properly use it.
